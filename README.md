# wp-personal-content-notes
"Personal notes" feature for multi-user WordPress site (sample code)
8/21/2017
Based on a recent project, this is some sample code showing one way to add a feature to a WordPress website
allowing users of the site to add personal notes to content and show it whenever they return to that content.

Feel free to use this if it helps you in a project you're working on, but bear in mind that this code is not
set up as a proper WordPress plugin and, owing to its simplicity, will certainly need to be adapted to fit
your needs. I assume no liability for anything that happens as a result of using this code.
